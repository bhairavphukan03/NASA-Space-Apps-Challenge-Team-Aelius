# Idea - 
This is a very unique idea on which we have proposed. We aim to build a blueprint of an interactive and immersive platform to improve public knowledge on the Sun and the many spacecraft exploring the Sun. Our idea bridges the gap between inspiring young space enthusiasts and the required facilities and guidance from experts to progress towards a better future in space developments.
